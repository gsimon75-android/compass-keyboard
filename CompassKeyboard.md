# Introduction #
The main goal of CompassKeyboard is to enable entering any character (including national characters and symbols of computer languages as well) with the same layouts.

Default layouts support Latin- and Cyrillic-based and Greek character sets, user-defineable external layouts are supported as well.


# Usage #
As soft keyboards are not for touch-typing, neither the usual 'qwerty' nor the dvorak layouts would make sense, so the keys are arranged by functional groups, the letters in alphabetical order, and the accented characters are available as modifications of their base character.

Supporting these many characters would require quit a lot of keys, way too much for a soft keyboard, so the functions of the keys had to be extended: in addition to tapping on them, you may 'drag' or 'swipe' them to the eight direction of the compass as well, the letter generated by a key will depend on the direction to which you dragged it. These strokes don't need to be long, just start them inside of the key and end on the outside of it.

This behaviour will let you enter nine times more characters than an usual tapping-only keyboard, although it may require some time to get used to it (thanks to the alphabetical ordering, the learning curve is quite steep).

# Built-in layouts #

Currently CompassKeyboard has three built-in layouts, one for the Latin-based alphabets, one for the Cyrillic-based ones and one for the Greek alphabet.

You may switch between the layouts (built-in or custom as well) without leaving the keyboard, just do a big swipe across the keyboard from top-left to bottom-right ('Spec' global swipe, see below) and choose one of L0..L5 on the top-leftmost key.


## Settings ##
In the settings you may review the currently installed layouts. The first three of them are the built-in ones that cannot be changed, but you are free to add any custom layouts from XML files by choosing the last option. These custom layouts will instantly appear on the list, provided that they are syntactically valid.
Custom layouts can be removed from the list, for this just tap on them, and then confirm your decision on the appearing dialog (please note that they will be removed only from the list, their XML file remains unchanged).

# Global swipes #
Especially for the Latin alphabet, in addition to the base characters there are quite a lot of accented ones in use: acute, circumflex, grave, double grave, diaeresis, hacek, macron, dot, ring or tilde are the most usual, but some languages use stroked letters as well. CompassKeyboard supports even these, all of them, still in one single layout. As these many characters would require too many keys, even of the 9-directional kind, so another feature had to be introduced: the global swipes.

If you make a large diagonal swipe from one corner of the keyboard to the opposite one, or one from the center top to bottom, or from the left side to the right, or the reverse, you activate an 'accented mode', similar to pressing a shift key on a regular keyboard. In these accented modes the base characters change their behaviour and their look, they will show and generate the accented version of the base character. A global swipe affects only the next keystroke, but if you would like to revert to the normal mode without entering any character, just tap/drag any character that has no function in this accented mode.

If you would like to enter uppercase accented characters, just tap shift first and then activate the required accented mode by its global swipe.

## Long tap ##
Although not used by the built-in layouts, there is a 9th global swipe, the long tap. To activate it (for a custom layout, for example), tap the screen and hold it for 1.5 seconds.

## in Latin layout ##
| **Global swipe** | **Accented mode** |   | **Others** |
|:-----------------|:------------------|:--|:-----------|
| NW               | grave             | ù |            |
| N                | circumflex        | û | double acute |
| NE               | acute             | ú |            |
| W                | diaeresis         | ü |            |
| E                | miscellaneous     | ū | dot, ring, macron, specials |
| SW               | tilde             | ũ |            |
| S                | caron/hacek       | ǔ |            |
| SE               | special           | ų | cedilla, comma, specials |

## in Cyrillic layout ##
| **Global swipe** | **Accented mode** |   | **Others** |
|:-----------------|:------------------|:--|:-----------|
| NW               | variant           | ы |            |
| NE               | soft              | й |            |
| SW               | hacek             | ӂ | specials   |
| SE               | special           | ӣ | specials   |

## in Greek layout ##
| **Global swipe** | **Accented mode** |   | **Others** |
|:-----------------|:------------------|:--|:-----------|
| SE               | special           | ς |            |

Even for these accented modes, there are some characters that have more variants than the accented modes we have, in such cases the less frequent variants are mapped to an accented mode of a nearby unused character: like 'ő' ('o' with double acute) had to be mapped to circumflex-'n', which is adjacent to 'o'. At first glance this may seem complicated, but the experience shows that it can be get used to quite quickly.


# Special keys #
The most frequently used non-alphabetic characters are available in the default mode of all layouts. Most of these are readily recognisable, however not all of them represent visual characters, for these some glyphs had to be displayed:

| **Key**          | **Symbol** | Location |
|:-----------------|:-----------|:---------|
| Shift            | ⇧          | on the lower-leftmost key |
| Ctrl             | C          |          |
| Caps lock        | ⇪          | on the lower-leftmost key in 'Shift' mode |
| Hide keyboard    | H          |          |
| Esc              | E          | on the lower-leftmost key in 'Spec' mode |
| Arrow keys       | ↑ ← → ↓    | on the navigational key |
| Enter            | ↲          |          |
| Page Up/Down     | ↟ ↡        | on the navigational key in 'Spec' mode |
| Home/End         | ↞ ↠        |          |
| Center           | ╳          |          |
| Backspace        | ↚          | on the lower-centermost key |
| Space            | ▆          |          |
| Tab              | ⇨          |          |
| Del              | ↛          | on the lower-centermost key in 'Spec' mode |
| Ins              | ↱          |          |
| F1..F10          | Ⅰ..Ⅹ       | on the numbers in 'Spec' mode |
| Layout 0..5      | L0..L5     | on the top-leftmost key in 'Spec' mode |

# Vibration #
Some people find useful if there is a sensible feedback of the keyboard events, so you may configure an optional single or double vibration signal when entering a character, choosing a modifier or cancelling an accented mode.

# Visual feedback #
If you prefer having a visual feedback about the symbols you are about to enter, you may choose two kinds of feedback (in addition to 'none') in the settings menu, separately for normal texts and for passwords:

## Toast ##
In this mode the currently selected symbol is displayed in the top-center of the screen in a floating box that disappears in a short time or when the symbol is entered.

## Highlight ##
Less visible than the previous (thus more useful for entering passwords), in this mode the currently selected symbol appears only on the key itself, but with a slightly larger font and a different colour.

# Sizing #

Mostly for the keys on the sides the border of the screen may make it difficult to perform outward movements, therefore you may find the width settings of the left, right and bottom margins useful.

Likewise, mostly in case of devices with large screens it you may find it annoying that the maximal size for the keys is limited, so here you may reconfigure this upper limit as well.


# Custom layouts #
Despite the best efforts for defining the default layouts as flexible as possible, you may find that another arrangement would fit your needs better, so CompassKeyboard supports loading a layout from a plain XML file as well. Although this feature gives you a complete control of the key layout and behaviour, designing such a file is somewhat a developers task and it is definitely a tedious work (believe me...), so before you decide to do so, please consider first whether it is really worth your time and efforts, and perhaps consult the document LayoutFormat.README and the built-in layouts, all available as part of the source code.

# Character sets #
Not all glyphs are supported on all phone models, so it might happen that instead of some national characters only a placeholder rectangle is displayed (this is the case on Galaxy S with some uppercase vowels with hacek accent).

To check whether your phone supports such a glyph or not, please visit the code charts of the [Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Multilingual_Plane#Basic_Multilingual_Plane) with your browser and check whether it has been displayed correctly.

Although it would be possible to add any alphabet that has a Unicode mapping, not all character sets are actually supported by the phones, so there are alphabets (like Armenian and Georgian) that aren't yet supported.


# Ideas for further development #

## Eastern languages like Chinese and Japanese ##
They have a writing system that is completely different from the alphabetic ones, so the best I can think of is to have an input area where the user could start drawing the (simplified) brush-strokes of the character, while the most frequent matching characters are displayed in the background, so he could either narrow the search by adding new strokes or select the wanted character by tapping it if it has already appeared.

## Arabic and Farsi ##
These languages use a right-to-left writing, don't distinguish upper- and lowercase letters, mark the vowels only by modifier 'accents', but they have different forms of letters at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the words, or when used separately.

Using the input framework of Android it seems possible to add context-sensitivity, so even such a keyboardf would be feasible.


# Licensing, price, feedback #
CompassKeyboard is released under a FreeBSD-style license, so you may redistribute and use it modified or unmodified as long as you don't strip my copyright notice off of it.

It is free of any charge, however, if you want to encourage further developments and you find CompassKeyboard useful enough to be worth a few dollars, you can donate some through PayPal: 'gabor.simon@mailbox.hu'.

If you have some ideas how CompassKeyboard could be improved, some features you would find useful, feel free to share it with me on my email address above. As this is only a hobby project for me, I cannot promise anything, but I will try to adapt at least the most popular ideas.
